# Step 1: Importing required libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Step 2: Locating an open source dataset from the web
# For this example, let's use a dataset from Kaggle.
# Dataset Description: The dataset contains information about wine quality, including various chemical properties.
# URL: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

# Step 3: Load the Dataset into pandas dataframe
# Let's load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsrscientist/DSData/master/winequality-red.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(data_url)

# Step 4: Data Preprocessing
# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()

# Describe the dataset to get initial statistics
initial_stats = df.describe()

# Variable descriptions
variable_descriptions = {
    "fixed acidity": "Amount of fixed acids in the wine",
    "volatile acidity": "Amount of volatile acids in the wine",
    "citric acid": "Amount of citric acid in the wine",
    "residual sugar": "Amount of residual sugar in the wine",
    "chlorides": "Amount of chlorides in the wine",
    "free sulfur dioxide": "Amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine",
    "total sulfur dioxide": "Amount of total sulfur dioxide in the wine",
    "density": "Density of the wine",
    "pH": "pH value of the wine",
    "sulphates": "Amount of sulphates in the wine",
    "alcohol": "Alcohol content of the wine",
    "quality": "Quality rating of the wine (between 0 and 10)"
}

# Check dimensions of the dataframe
dimensions = df.shape

# Step 5: Data Formatting and Data Normalization
# Summarize the types of variables by checking data types
data_types_summary = df.dtypes

# Step 6: Turning categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python
# This dataset does not contain categorical variables that need to be converted
# If categorical variables were present, we could use techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding

# Print the results
